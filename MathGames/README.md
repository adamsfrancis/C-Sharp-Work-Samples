# Math Games

### The goal of this project was to build a math game that takes two inputs from the user: number of questions, and which operator the questions should utilize. Then produce that "quiz," and score the results.

I approached this project as an exercise in using delegates. The project was requested by a former professor, to utilize during the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy Cloud Application Developer course. I attempted to write the code at the level I would have been roughly midway through the course to see what kind of obstacles a student would encounter.
